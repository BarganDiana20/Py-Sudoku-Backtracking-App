## Sudoku Game Overview  
The classic Sudoku game consists of completing a 9 × 9 grid squares, which is divided into 3 × 3 squares. The goal of the game is to fill each cell with a number from 1 to 9, ensuring that no numbers are repeated in any row or column of the grid, nor within each 3 × 3 square. The game starts with a partially filled grid containing a certain number of randomly given values that satisfy the problem's restrictions.
The player must find the remaining numbers based on the positions of the numbers already given.
